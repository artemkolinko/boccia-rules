      <p><strong>Scope and Application</strong></p>
      <p>
        These BISFed (Boccia International Sport Federation) International
        Boccia Rules define how the sport of Boccia should be played. These
        rules apply to all World Boccia sanctioned tournaments. A World Boccia
        sanctioned tournament is an event recognised as part of the BISFed
        Competition System. In addition to these International Boccia Rules, a
        sanctioned competition must apply the following BISFed rules:
      </p>
      <p>· BISFed Classification Rules</p>
      <p>· BISFed Anti-Doping Rules</p>
      <p>· BISFed Competition & Ranking Rules</p>
      <p>
        Please consult these regulations alongside the rules presented in this
        document to understand what is required when competing in a World Boccia
        sanctioned tournament. BISFed and a host organising committee may
        publish rule clarifications in the Technical Guide for a tournament in
        agreement with the BISFed Technical Delegate for the tournament. A rule
        clarification must only describe a specific application of a rule for
        that tournament and must not amend the meaning of a rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        BISFed recognises that situations may arise that have not been covered
        by the rules defined in this document. Any circumstances that require a
        change to the rules before a tournament has started must be raised prior
        to the start of the Tournament and confirmed at the Technical Meeting by
        the Head Referee and Technical Delegate to all competitors. Any
        circumstance that requires a decision to be made during a tournament
        will be made in consultation with the Head Referee and Technical
        Delegate who will have the final decision. These circumstances must be
        reported to BISFed immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        The BISFed International Boccia Rules may be adapted by BISFed Member
        Nations for national level tournaments or any other competition that is
        not part of the BISFed Competition System.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Spirit of the Game</strong></p>
      <p>
        The ethics and spirit of the Game are similar to those of tennis. Crowd
        participation is welcomed and encouraged. However, spectators, including
        Team members not in competition, are encouraged to remain quiet during
        the action of an Athlete propelling the ball. Spectators may be asked to
        leave for unacceptable behaviour.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Translations</strong></p>
      <p>
        An editable version of the rules is available for Members wishing to
        translate the rules into other languages. Email
        <a href="mailto:admin@bisfed.com">admin@bisfed.com</a> if you would like
        to receive this document. BISFed will endeavour to publish translated
        documents however, for the avoidance of doubt, the English version is
        the OFFICIAL copy for all dispute resolutions.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Photography</strong></p>
      <p>
        No flash photography is allowed. Video filming of matches is permitted.
        However, tripods and cameras on the FOP may only be placed with approval
        from the HR or TD.

      <p id="event_types"><strong>2. Event Types</strong></p>
      <p>There are three types of events in the BISFed Competition System:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>2.1 Individual</strong><strong></strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are eight individual events with a male and female event for each
        recognised classification (BC1, BC2, BC3, and BC4). Athletes must be
        classified in the corresponding sport class to compete.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Individual events, a match consists of four (4) ends. Each
        athlete initiates two ends with control of the Jack alternating between
        athletes. Each athlete has six (6) coloured balls and must enter the
        call room with no more than 6 red and 6 blue balls, plus 1 jack ball.
        The Side playing red balls will occupy throwing box 3, and the Side
        playing blue balls will occupy throwing box 4.
      </p>

      <p>
        BC1 athletes and BC4 foot players have a Sport Assistant to help them on
        court. BC3 athletes have a Ramp Operator to assist them. Also, one Coach
        or one Coaching Assistant (CA) may accompany each side in all divisions
        to the Court. The coach/coaching assistant must sit in the designated
        area at the end of the court.
      </p>

      <p><strong>2.2</strong> <strong>Pairs</strong></p>
      <p>
        There are two pair events, BC3 Pair and BC4 Pair. Athletes must be
        classified in the corresponding sport class to compete. Each Pair must
        have one male and one female athlete.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the BC3 and BC4 Pair events a match consists of four (4) Ends. Each
        athlete initiates one End with the control of the Jack passing in
        numerical order from throwing box 2 to 5. Athletes play with three (3)
        coloured balls each and must enter the call room with no more than 3 red
        and 3 blue balls, plus 1 jack ball for each pair. The Side playing red
        balls will occupy throwing boxes 2 and 4, and the Side playing blue
        balls will occupy throwing boxes 3 and 5.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the BC3 Pair each athlete is assisted by a Ramp Operator who must
        abide by the Ramp Operator Rules. One Coach or one Coaching Assistant
        may accompany each Pair to the Court. During the End the coach/coaching
        assistant must sit in the designated area at the end of the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        A substitute for each pair will only be allowed at specified youth
        international events.
      </p>

      <p><strong>2.3 Team</strong></p>
      <p>
        There is one team event, for the BC1 and BC2 classes. Athletes must be
        classified as BC1 or BC2 athletes. A Team must play the match with three
        athletes and must have, at least, one male athlete, one female athlete,
        and one BC1 athlete.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Team event a match consists of six (6) Ends. Each athlete
        initiates one End with the control of the Jack passing in numerical
        order from throwing box 1 to 6. Athletes have two (2) coloured balls
        each and must enter the call room with no more than 2 red and 2 blue
        balls per athlete, plus 1 jack ball for each team. The Side playing red
        balls will occupy throwing boxes 1, 3 & 5 and the Side playing blue
        balls will occupy throwing boxes 2, 4 & 6.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each Team is allowed one Sport Assistant. One Coach or one Coaching
        Assistant may accompany each Team to the Court. During the end the
        coach/coaching assistant must sit in the designated area at the end of
        the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        Substitutes for each team will only be allowed at specified youth
        international events.
      </p>

      <p id="tournament_setup"><strong>3. Tournament Setup</strong></p>

      <p><strong>3.1</strong> THE COURT</p>
      <p>
        The surface should be flat and smooth (e.g., polished concrete, wooden,
        natural or synthetic rubber.) The surface should be clean. Nothing may
        be used to interfere with the playing surface (for example, powders of
        any kind).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Court dimensions are 12.5m x 6m with the throwing area divided into
        six throwing boxes. All measurements of the boundary lines are measured
        to the inside of the relevant line. Lines dividing the throwing boxes
        and the lines for the cross are measured to a thin pencil line with the
        tape evenly spread over either side of that mark. The throwing line and
        the V line will be placed inside the non-valid area for Jack (ref.:
        Boccia Court Layout at the back of this rulebook).
      </p>
      <p>
        All court markings should be between 1.9cm & 7cm wide and must be easily
        discernible. Adhesive tape may be used to mark lines. Wide tape, 4cm –
        7cm wide, will be used for: external boundary lines, throwing line, and
        the V line. Narrow tape, 1.9 to 2.6cm wide, should be used for: the
        lines dividing throwing boxes, the target box, and the cross. The inside
        dimension of the target box is 35cm x 35cm. Narrow tape is to be placed
        on the outside of the 35cm square target box.
      </p>
      <p><strong>3.2</strong> THE SCOREBOARD</p>
      <p>
        The scoreboard is to be placed in a position where all Athletes
        competing in the match can clearly see it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>3.3</strong> TIMING EQUIPMENT</p>
      <p>Timing equipment should be electronic.</p>
      <p><strong>3.4</strong> RED/BLUE COLOUR INDICATOR</p>
      <p>
        The indicator is a coloured paddle used by the Referee to show which
        Side (red or blue) goes next. The Referee uses the indicator and his or
        her fingers to show the score at the end of each End and at the end of
        the match.
      </p>
      <p><strong>3.5</strong> MEASURING DEVICES</p>
      <p>
        Ball templates are used to confirm the circumference range of a boccia
        ball. Devices including tape measures, callipers, feeler gauges,
        flashlight are used by the Referees to measure distances on court.
      </p>
      <p id="equipment_check"><strong>4 Equipment Check</strong></p>
      <p>
        All testing devices required to conduct a tournament must be approved by
        the BISFed Technical Delegate and/or Head Referee of each sanctioned
        event.
      </p>
      <p>
        An equipment check must take place at the start of a tournament for the
        following items of equipment:
      </p>
      <p>· Wheelchairs</p>
      <p>· Ramps</p>
      <p>· Pointers</p>
      <p>· Gloves</p>
      <p>· Splints</p>
      <p>· Communication Devices</p>
      <p>
        The Head Referee and/or their designate will conduct the checks at a
        time determined by the Technical Delegate. This should take place before
        competition begins. Checked and approved equipment will receive an
        official stamp or sticker for each item including a sticker for every
        section of the ramp. Gloves, splints or other similar devices that the
        Athlete uses on court need documented approval from a Classifier which
        must be brought to Equipment Check and to the Call Room. Athletes using
        communication devices on the FOP must have these devices approved at
        Equipment Check and must receive the official stamp/sticker. A
        communication device will only be approved if it is essential to enable
        the athlete to communicate with the referee, to instruct their assistant
        within the permitted rules, for communication on court, or if required
        for the movement of their wheelchair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Requests to certify any items after the equipment checks will not be
        permitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equipment is subject to random checks at any time during a tournament at
        the sole discretion of the Referee on court or the Head Referee. If
        equipment used on court is found to be out of compliance a yellow card
        will be given to the Athlete. (ref: 15.9.8). The side may then use a
        technical time-out to fix or replace the equipment according to rule
        19.1. If the athlete is not able to fix or replace the equipment within
        the time available, the equipment cannot be used anymore in that match.
        If an Athlete's equipment (wheelchair, ramp, gloves, splints and other
        aids) fails the criteria on a second occasion on a random check, that
        Athlete receives a second yellow card and will forfeit the current
        match.
      </p>

      <p id="assistive_devices"><strong>4.1 ASSISTIVE DEVICES</strong></p>
      <p>
        Assistive Devices, such as <strong>ramps and pointers</strong> used by
        Athletes in the BC3 Division are subject to approval at the Equipment
        Check of each tournament. <strong>Gloves</strong> and/or
        <strong>splints</strong> used by any Athlete, on their throwing hand,
        must have documented approval from Classification that must be brought
        to the Equipment Check and the Call Room.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.1.1</strong> A ramp when laid on its side must fit into an
        area measuring 2.5m x 1m. This area is three dimensional; no part of the
        ramp is allowed to hang over the inside of any line. Ramps must have the
        base and all extensions extended to the maximum during the measurement.
        This includes any device that holds the ball in place beyond the extent
        of the ramp. It MUST be impossible for the ramp to extend beyond the
        maximum limit, otherwise it is illegal. Marks or lines to indicate the
        maximum allowable extension of any portion of the ramp or ball holder
        are NOT allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.1.2</strong> To prevent damage, only the Ramp Operator or the
        Coach should handle the ramp during equipment checks. Once approved at
        the Equipment Check, the Referee will apply the validation stamp or
        sticker supplied by the HOC for the Competition to all approved
        equipment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>4.1.3</strong> A ramp may not contain any mechanical device that
        would aid propulsion, speed up or slow down the ball or aid the
        orientation of the ramp (e.g., lasers, levels, brakes, sighting devices,
        scopes, etc.). Such mechanical devices are not permitted in the Call
        Room or on the Field Of Play. Once the Athlete releases the ball,
        nothing should obstruct the ball in any way. A raised top is not
        allowed. A fixed or temporary accessory attachment on the ramp may not
        be used for sighting/aiming/orienting the ramp. This includes hoops,
        rings, and holders. Any side rail or other protrusion must not exceed
        the height (diameter) of the ball. The end/top rail must not exceed the
        height of the side rails.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.1.4</strong> When propelling a ball, the ramp may not overhang
        any portion of the throwing line. (Imagine the line as a solid wall that
        may not be touched or penetrated.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.1.5</strong> There is no restriction on the length of the
        pointer used by the Athlete to release the ball from the ramp. The
        pointer must be in direct contact with the Athlete. (head, mouth, arm,
        leg, etc.). Pointers must have direct contact with the ball and the
        Athlete only when releasing the ball. A pointer is NOT allowed to be
        attached to the wheelchair during the release. (ref.: 15.5.4.) The
        release of the ball must be caused by the action of the Athlete using
        the pointer. It is acceptable for an athlete to move his/her own
        wheelchair, entirely by him/herself while in contact with the ball to
        release the ball. Lifting or lowering a gate is not legal. Strings,
        ribbons, cloth strips, etc., are not pointers. Approved pointers will
        receive validation stickers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.1.6</strong> After the Referee presents the Jack, and before
        propelling the Jack, the Athlete propelling must clearly swing their
        ramp at least 20 cm to the left and 20 cm to the right – hereinafter
        referred to as “the two-way swing” (ref.: 15.5.9). (This ensures that
        the Ramp Operator cannot assist in lining up the first shot, while the
        Referee is otherwise occupied.) The ramp must NOT have any marks or any
        device to indicate the starting position of the ramp for the two-way
        swing. (e.g. A graduated collar on the column is NOT allowed.)
      </p>
      <p>
        For tie-break Ends, in both Individual and Pair play, each Athlete must
        make the two-way swing prior to propelling their first ball (for Pairs,
        this is a simultaneous swing), but only after the Referee indicates it
        is their turn (ref: 13.5). The ramp must also undergo the two-way swing
        before propelling any penalty ball.
      </p>
      <p>
        Athletes that have balls remaining must reorient the ramp before
        releasing their ball by making the two-way swing when they or their
        teammate returns from the playing area (for Pairs, this is a
        simultaneous swing - both Athletes MUST swing their ramp prior to the
        release of the ball). If the Athlete has no balls remaining, he/she does
        not need to make this swing (ref.: 15.5.10).
      </p>
      <p>It is not required to swing the ramp between the other plays.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.1.7</strong> An Athlete may use more than one pointer during a
        match. All assistive devices must remain in the athlete's throwing box
        for the entire End or be securely placed on the athlete’s wheelchair. If
        the Athlete wishes to use any items (bottles, coats, pins, flags…) or
        other equipment (pointer, ramp or ramp extension…) during an End, these
        items must be on the floor inside the Athlete’s throwing box or securely
        placed on the athlete’s wheelchair at the beginning of that End. If an
        item is taken out of the Athlete’s throwing box during the End, the
        Referee will judge according to rule 15.7.1, 15.7.4.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.1.8</strong> If a player’s equipment breaks during a match,
        the Referee will stop the clock and the relevant side will be given a
        ten (10) minute technical time-out to repair the equipment. In a Pairs
        match, an Athlete may share a ramp with his/her teammate if necessary. A
        replacement ramp or wheelchair may be substituted between Ends only,
        providing the replacement bears the validation stamp/sticker for the
        competition. The Head Referee must be notified of any such replacement.
        Replacements may come from outside the FOP (ref 4.2.2; 19.) A side may
        have only one technical time-out per match.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.1.9</strong> Athletes that require the assistance of gloves or
        splints on their throwing hand, or the use of any other such aids must
        have documented approval for the use of those items from Classification.
        The Classification document is valid for the duration stated on the
        document. (Classification can be permanent, or temporary)
      </p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p id="wheelchairs"><strong>4.2 WHEELCHAIRS</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.2.1</strong> Competitors must be seated in a wheelchair to
        compete. Scooters or cots/beds (with documented approval from
        Classification) may also be used. There is no restriction on seat height
        for BC3 Athletes, so long as they remain seated when releasing a ball.
        For all other Athletes the maximum seat height is 66 cm from the floor
        to the lowest point of where the Athlete's buttock is in contact with
        the seat cushion. (ref.: 15.7.3)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.2.2</strong> If a wheelchair breaks during the match, time
        must be stopped and the side will be given one ten (10) minute technical
        time out per match for repairs. If the wheelchair cannot be repaired the
        Athlete may replace the broken wheelchair with another approved
        wheelchair between ends, or must carry on playing with the broken
        wheelchair. Any balls the athlete cannot play become dead balls.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.2.3</strong> In case of a dispute involving a wheelchair the
        Head Referee in conjunction with the Technical Delegate shall decide the
        ruling. Their decision is final.
      </p>
      <p><strong>4.3 Adaptations to wheelchairs</strong>.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.3.1</strong> Athletes are permitted to use postural supports
        on their competition wheelchair for the purpose of supporting
        stabilisation of the body. These supports may include pelvic straps,
        chest straps or harnesses, ankle straps, pommels, leg/foot straps,
        thoracic supports. This type of support must be reviewed, approved and
        documented during the Classification process.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>4.3.2</strong> Any additional device added to the Athlete’s
        sport specific wheelchair will be reviewed by both Referees and
        Classifiers. NO additional device may be added to the sport wheelchair
        that will provide additional stability, or control or direct the Upper
        Limb/Lower Limb (UL/LL) when propelling the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>4.3.3</strong> A Referee or Classifier has the authority to ask
        the Athlete to remove any added undocumented device, that is deemed to
        give the Athlete an unfair advantage when propelling the ball into the
        playing area (e.g., an external guide that assists the direction of a
        throw/kick/release).
      </p>
      <p id="boccia_balls"><strong>5. BOCCIA BALLS</strong></p>
      <p>
        In BISFed sanctioned competitions, each athlete or side may use their
        own set of boccia balls. A set of boccia balls consists of six red
        balls, six blue balls and one white jack ball. Only one full set per
        side is permitted in the call room. In the individual divisions each
        athlete may use their own jack. In Team and Pair divisions, each side
        must use only one jack. If an athlete or side does not bring their own
        balls to the Call Room, then competition balls will be provided to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be considered legal, a boccia ball must meet the following criteria:
      </p>
      <p><strong>5.1 Construction</strong></p>
      <p>
        From 1st January 2023, a ball must be from a licensed manufacturer. The
        ball must be marked with the official manufacturer logo and the official
        BISFed licensed logo.
      </p>

      <p>
        A ball that was not awarded a licence by 1st January each year must only
        be released for sale by a manufacturer from the close of the last Major
        or Qualification tier event (see section 1.3 in Competition & Ranking
        Manual) in that calendar year.
      </p>
      <p>
        A ball must weigh 275 g. +/- 12 g and the circumference must be 270 mm
        +/- 8mm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The balls must have a defined colour of red, blue, or white and each
        colour must fall within the BISFed acceptable colour range provided to
        manufacturers.
      </p>

      <p>
        A ball must be spherical and constructed from panels that are uniformly
        sized. All panels must be uniformly sewn together to define the
        spherical shape. All panels must be the same type of material.
      </p>

      <p>
        A ball must be constructed from materials with low elongation and
        stretch characteristics including vinyl, polyurethane fabric, leather,
        synthetic leather, suede, or other similar material.
      </p>

      <p>
        A ball must be filled with uniformly sized pellets or beads made of
        polyethylene or other similar plastic, or natural inert materials.
        Materials must be non-conductive, non-metallic, and non-magnetic.
      </p>

      <p><strong>5.2 Condition</strong></p>
      <p>
        A ball must be in good condition. In good condition means fit for
        intended purpose, of satisfactory quality, not damaged and capable of
        any agreed standard of performance. The manufacturer logo and BISFed
        logo must both be visible and identifiable.
      </p>

      <p>
        A ball must not be tampered with and will be considered to have been
        tampered with if it differs from the original ball submitted by the
        licensed manufacturer, except where a difference can be accounted for
        due to normal wear and tear or acceptable preparation for play. Anything
        that changes the property of the surface or filling of the ball that can
        be seen or felt will be deemed to be tampering.
      </p>

      <p>
        Normal wear is the expected decline in condition from typical use of a
        ball, such as repeatedly being propelled onto court. For example, there
        may be a pattern of wear due to the throwing style or grip used by an
        athlete, or where a ball interacts with a consistent point of a ramp or
        pointer such as a circular pattern on a ball in line with the
        arrow/marker.
      </p>

      <p>
        Acceptable preparation for play is the permitted maintenance of a ball
        so that it remains in a good condition, such as maintaining the weight
        and desired softness of a ball. For example, the ball may be softened,
        or the same pellets or beads as were originally used in the ball may be
        replaced to maintain the weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        The surface of the ball must not have any visible punctures or cuts. The
        ball must not have any holes at the corners (vertex) of the panels when
        compared to an original ball or more than two areas of delamination.
        Delamination means that part of the panel is splitting apart into
        layers. Any single area of delamination must be less than 1 cm in
        length. The total length of all areas of delamination must not exceed 2
        cm.
      </p>

      <p>
        The surface of the ball must be free of stickers, decals, or transfers.
        A ball may be marked with a pen or marker for the purpose of identifying
        the ball (e.g., numbers or letters) and/or for the purpose of
        identifying how the ball should be used (e.g., a dot or arrow). The
        original colour of the panel must be identifiable around any mark added
        to the panel. There must not be any markings on or across a seam, so
        that the seam can still be seen and inspected. There must not be any
        markings over the approved manufacturer or approved BISFed logo.
      </p>

      <p>
        The surface of the ball must not have any substances applied to it. The
        surface of the ball must not have any abrasions applied to it that do
        not come from the normal use of a ball. There must not be any visible
        scuff marks or any areas of rubbing, sanding, or scraping that result in
        significant differences in the texture of the ball. There must not be
        any abrasions along the length of one or more seams.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ball must not have ripped or missing threads and no more than two
        stitches that have been re-sewn. The stitching must be the same as the
        original manufacturer stitching and must be consistent across the
        entirety of the ball.
      </p>

      <p><strong>5.3 Confiscated Balls</strong></p>
      <p>
        If a ball fails a pre-match or post-match ball check, the ball will be
        confiscated. Once a ball is confiscated, after checking with the HR/AHR,
        the IR will then confirm if there's a suspicion of the ball being
        tampered or not. Only if the suspicion exists, a three-person panel will
        review the confiscated ball. The panel must be made up of at least two
        of either the Head Referee, Assistant Head Referee, Technical Delegate,
        or Assistant Technical Delegate. The third member can be an
        International Referee who was not involved in the initial decision. This
        panel will be formed immediately after the decision to confiscate a ball
        is made. If the initial decision to confiscate the ball is made in the
        call room, the panel must review the ball whilst the match is being
        played and reach a decision by the completion of the match. If the
        initial decision to confiscate the ball is made at the end of the match,
        the panel must review the ball before the result of the match is
        confirmed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The panel will review the initial decision to confiscate the ball and
        complete further tests to determine whether a ball has been tampered
        with or is only a ‘failed ball’. The panel will assess the ball and
        review the initial decision by repeating the pre-match testing
        procedures. The panel may use two additional tests to assess whether the
        ball has been tampered with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Needle/Probe Test</li>
        <li>Friction Test</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If, after the panel have reviewed a ball, it is decided it
        <strong>has</strong> <strong>not</strong> been tampered with, then the
        ball will be held until the end of the tournament and then returned to
        the athlete.
      </p>

      <p>
        If, after the panel have reviewed a ball, it is decided it
        <strong>has</strong> been tampered with, then the panel will award a red
        card and the athlete will be disqualified from the tournament. The
        athlete will also be reported under the BISFed Code of Ethics to a
        BISFed Ethics Commission. The tampered ball(s) will be retained by
        BISFed as evidence for the BISFed Ethics Commission. Please refer to the
        BISFed Code of Ethics for more information on the process of the Ethics
        Commission.

      <p id="warm_up"><strong>6. Warm Up</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.1</strong> Prior to the start of each match Athletes will be
        allocated a time period to warm up in the designated Warm Up Area.
        During scheduled competition time, the Warm Up Area may only be used by
        the competitors who will compete in the next scheduled match. Athletes
        and Athlete supporters (Coach/CA, SA, RO) may only enter the Warm Up
        Area and proceed to their designated warm up court within their
        scheduled time. (Ref 15.9.1)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.1.1</strong> Warm Up time frame: for individual matches, the
        Warm Up Area will open 90 minutes before the scheduled start time of the

        the scheduled start time of the match and will close 5 minutes before
        the Call Room opens for the match. When the Call Room closes for the
        last matches of the day, Athletes who did not play during the day may
        use the Warm Up Area to train for 60 minutes. The TD may adjust this
        time frame to allow reasonable access to the Warm Up Area and to
        accommodate the competition schedule. Participants will be informed of
        any changes to the normal schedule.

        visible from the front and may be fixed to the competitor or the
        wheelchair. ROs must wear the bib number that corresponds to the Athlete
        they are assisting, clearly visible on their back. All other SAs must
        have the bib number on their chest. In Team Division, the SA may wear
        the bib number of any of the BC1 Athletes in that match. Failure to
        comply with this requirement will result in entry being refused to the
        Call Room.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.4</strong> Registration for all matches is done at the Call
        Room desk, which is at the entrance to the Call Room. A Side that is not
        present in the Call Room on time will forfeit the match.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.4.1</strong> For Individual Division, all Athletes must be
        registered between thirty (30) and fifteen (15) minutes before the
        scheduled start time of a match in which they are scheduled to
        participate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.4.2</strong> For Team and Pair Division, all Athletes must be
        registered between forty-five (45) and twenty (20) minutes before the
        scheduled start time of a match in which they are due to participate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.4.3</strong> Each Side (Individual, Team or Pair, including
        any SA/RO and the Coach/CA) must register together and must bring all
        their equipment and balls with them. Each Side should bring to the Call
        Room only the items necessary to compete.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.5</strong> Once registered and inside the Call Room, Athletes,
        Coaches/CA and SA/RO may not leave the Call Room. Should they do so,
        they will not be allowed to re-enter and will not take further part in
        the current match (rule 7.12 is an exception.) Any other exceptions will
        be considered by the Head Referee and/or the Technical Delegate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.6</strong> All Sides must remain in the Call Room in their
        designated court area immediately after they have registered. If an
        Athlete needs to play back-to-back games, the Coach/CA or Team Manager
        may, with the TD's permission, register the Athlete for the following
        game. This includes playoff games when the Athlete's progression to the
        next level does not leave enough time to comply with Call Room time
        constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.7</strong> At the appointed time the Call Room doors will be
        closed and no other person or equipment or balls may enter or take part
        in the match (exceptions may be considered by the Head Referee or
        designate).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.8</strong> Referees for each match will enter the Call Room to
        prepare for the match at the latest when the Call Room door closes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.9</strong> Athletes may be asked to show their competitor
        numbers, accreditation tag, and Classification documentation to the
        Referee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.10</strong> All equipment will be checked in the Call Room to
        verify that the equipment has been awarded an official sticker for use
        during the tournament. Any equipment that fails a check cannot be used
        on court, and earns a yellow card.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.11</strong> Coin toss - the coin toss will be conducted in the
        Call Room. The Referee will flip a coin and the winning Side chooses
        whether to play red or blue. Sides are permitted to gently examine (with
        care and the Referee’s oversight) an opposing Side’s Boccia balls, after
        the coin toss.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.12</strong> If there is a schedule delay while the Call Room
        is in operation, the Head Referee or designate, can agree to a request
        to use the toilet under the following guidelines:
      </p>
      <p>· the other Side of that match must be informed;</p>
      <p>· an administrative member must accompany that Athlete;</p>
      <p>
        · the Athlete must return to the Call Room within ten (10) minutes;
        failure to return in time results in forfeit of the match.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.13</strong> Rule 7.4 will not apply if the Host Organization
        causes a delay. If matches are delayed, the HOC will notify all Team
        Managers as soon as possible in writing and the TD will revise the
        schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.14</strong> Translators may only enter the Call Room or the
        FOP, if asked to do so by a Referee. The translator must be present in
        the designated area in order to be eligible to enter the Call Room or
        FOP.
      </p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p id="pre_match_ball_check"><strong>8. Pre-Match Ball Check</strong></p>
      <p>
        Each athlete or side must present their balls in the Call Room to be
        tested before every match. The tests will confirm that each ball meets
        the criteria that define the construction and condition of a legal
        boccia ball.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the coin toss there will be testing for each of the seven (7)
        balls each side will use during play (e.g., jack ball plus six coloured
        balls) for every court. The tests that will be completed in the call
        room are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Roll Test</li>
        <li>Ball Inspection</li>
        <li>Circumference Test</li>
        <li>Weight Test</li>
        <li>Metal Detection Test</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The procedure for these tests can be found in the Referee’s Procedure
        Manual.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one or more balls fail one or more of these tests, the failed ball
        will be confiscated from the athlete and the athlete will receive a
        yellow card. A failed red or blue ball will not be replaced. A failed
        jack ball will be replaced by an equivalent competition jack ball
        selected by the referee.
      </p>
      <p>
        The athlete or side will play with any remaining balls that have passed
        all the call room tests. If one Athlete has more than one ball rejected
        during the same check, the offence will incur only one yellow card; but
        the Athlete will play with one less ball for each ball that is
        confiscated.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an Athlete's ball(s) fails the criteria during the ball check for a
        subsequent match, that Athlete receives a second yellow card and will
        forfeit the match under rules 15.10.2 and 15.10.3.
      </p>
      <p>
        Athletes, SAs/ROs and Coaches/Coaching Assistants may observe the ball
        check. If a ball fails, the test is not reattempted, unless the referee
        did not follow the correct test procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Team and Pair Division Athletes must identify each Athlete’s
        equipment and balls in the Call Room so that if an item fails a check,
        it can be correctly associated with the correct Athlete. If ownership is
        not admitted, the captain plays with the lesser number of ball(s) (ref.:
        15.9.2).
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the call room check has been completed, the referee will retain the
        balls until both sides arrive on court and distribute them after all
        bags are stored at the score table.

      <p><strong>ON COURT</strong></p>
      <p id="roles_and_responsibilities">
        <strong>9 Roles & Responsibilities</strong>
      </p>
      <p><strong>9.1 Athlete</strong></p>
      <p>
        The athlete is the individual that is in control of releasing the ball.
        He/she must propel the ball unassisted, without any contact from anyone
        during the release of the ball.
      </p>
      <p><strong>9.1.1 The Captain's Responsibility</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.1.1.1</strong> In Team and Pair Division, each Side is led by
        a captain for each match. A letter “C”, clearly visible to the Referee,
        must clearly identify the captain to the Referee. Each captain, club or
        country is responsible for providing the “C”. The captain will act as
        the executive of the Team/Pair and assume the following
        responsibilities:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.1.1.2</strong> Representing the Team/Pair at the coin toss and
        deciding whether to play red or blue balls.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.1.1.3</strong> Deciding which Team/Pair member should play
        during the match, including any penalty balls.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.1.1.4</strong> Calling a technical or medical time out. The
        Coach, SA, RO, or CA may also call a technical or medical time out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.1.1.5</strong> Acknowledging the Referee's decision in the
        process of scoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.1.1.6</strong> Consulting with the Referee in the situation of
        a disrupted End or where there is a dispute.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.1.1.7</strong> Signing the score sheet or nominating someone
        to sign on their behalf. The person signing must sign his or her own
        name. When using the electronic score sheet, the Athlete may confirm
        agreement by clicking “OK” him/herself or give consent to the
        Scorekeeper or Referee to click “OK” on his/her behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.1.1.8</strong> Resolving a dispute. As outlined in Rule 16.1,
        the captain/athlete is the one that must ask for clarification. The
        Coach, CA or SA/RO may also speak to the referee, with referee
        permission, during the dispute. If translation is necessary a translator
        may also attend as per Rule 17.8 and 17.9
      </p>

      <p><strong>9.2 Athlete Assistants</strong></p>

      <p><strong>9.2.1 Ramp Operator</strong></p>
      <p>
        A Ramp Operator is a recognised Athlete and must conform to the rules
        applied to Athletes except as it applies to Classification. In this Rule
        Book, Ramp Operators must follow the rules assigned to Ramp Operators.
        When “Athlete” is mentioned in this Rule book, it refers to the
        individual(s) propelling the ball. The Ramp Operator must abide by the
        BISFed Policy on the Nationality of Competitors. A RO may assist only
        one Athlete. The RO must be the same individual for the entire
        competition; unless the RO becomes ill. If ill, the RO may be
        substituted. For a substitution to be allowed, a medical document
        confirming the illness must be provided to the HR and the Competition
        Information desk must be notified prior to the opening of the warm up
        courts for the match in question. The opponent must be notified of a
        substitution
        <i>immediately</i> when the warm up courts become available. Any RO
        substitute must have a BC3 RO license and must have completed the
        anti-doping training.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ramp Operators assist BC3 Athletes by operating the ramp as directed by
        the Athlete. Ramp Operators must be positioned inside their Athletes’
        throwing box and may not look into the playing area during the Ends.
        Ramp
        <a>Operators perform tasks such as:</a>
      </p>
      <p>· Positioning the ramp – when directed to do so -- by the Athlete;</p>
      <p>
        · Adjusting or stabilising the Athlete’s chair – when directed to do so
        -- by the Athlete;
      </p>
      <p>
        · Adjusting the Athlete’s position – when directed to do so -- by the
        Athlete;
      </p>
      <p>
        · Rolling and /or passing a ball to the Athlete – when directed to do so
        -- by the Athlete;
      </p>
      <p>· Performing routine actions before or after releasing the ball;</p>
      <p>
        · Picking up balls after each End – after the Referee picks up the Jack
        or penalty ball and says, “one minute!”
      </p>
      <p>
        · Relaying conversations between Athlete and Referee – with Referee
        approval
      </p>
      <p>When the ball is being released, the Ramp Operator (ref.:15.5.5)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          must not have direct physical contact with the Athlete (no touching
          the Athlete whatsoever)
        </li>
        <li>
          must not help the Athlete by pushing or adjusting the wheelchair;
        </li>
        <li>must not be touching the pointer.(ref.:15.5.6)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A Ramp Operator may not look into the playing area during the progress
        of an End (ref.:15.6.2).
      </p>

      <p><strong>9.2.2 Sport Assistant</strong></p>
      <p>
        BC1 Athletes and BC4 foot players are allowed to have a Sport Assistant.
        BC1 and BC4 foot players’ Sport Assistant should be positioned behind
        the Athlete’s own throwing box and may enter the throwing box when
        directed by their Athlete. Sport Assistants perform the same tasks as a
        Ramp Operator with the exception of positioning a ramp.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the athlete starts playing the shot, the Sport Assistant is not
        allowed to have direct physical contact with the Athlete (no touching
        the Athlete whatsoever ref.:15.5.5); and is not allowed to help the
        Athlete by pushing or adjusting the wheelchair.
      </p>
      <p><strong>9.2.3 Coach</strong></p>
      <p>
        One Coach or Coaching Assistant per side is allowed to enter the Warm Up
        area, the Call Room and the FOP for each Division (ref.: 6.2, 7.2). This
        includes the Individual Division.
      </p>
      <p><strong>9.2.4 Coaching Assistant</strong></p>
      <p>
        A Coaching Assistant accompanies an Athlete in place of a Coach and has
        the same allowances as a Coach. Only one or the other (Coach or CA) is
        allowed to accompany the Athlete in the warm up area, call room or FOP.
        During the End, the CA (or Coach) must be seated beside the score table
        in the Coach section.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Coaching Assistant may be anyone that is a registered participant from
        the same country as the athlete being accompanied.
      </p>

      <p id="play"><strong>10. Play</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10.1 On Court Warm Up</strong></p>
      <p>
        Prior to the start of the match, a Side may warm up by playing 6
        coloured balls and the jack within a 2-minute timeframe. In individual
        competition, this warm up is done by both Sides simultaneously. In teams
        & pairs competitions, warm ups are done separately.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.1.1 Individual competition procedure: Proceed from the Call Room to
        the assigned court on the FOP, once on court, both sides will position
        themselves in their designated throwing boxes. The Referee will indicate
        the start of a 2-minute warm up during which time Sides may propel all
        their balls, including the Jack. Both sides may play warm up balls on
        both sides of the court. Both sides are expected to behave in a
        cooperative manner as to give each other space to play these balls. If
        the referee determines that one Side is not behaving cooperatively (eg.
        continuously blocking the other Side’s line to play a certain shot), a
        yellow card will be given to the Athlete.
      </p>
      <p>
        The warm up is finished when both Sides have played all their balls or
        when 2 minutes have expired, (whichever comes first.)
      </p>
      <p>
        10.1.2 Teams & pairs competitions procedure: proceed from the Call Room
        to the assigned court on the FOP, once on court, the Side warming up
        first will position themselves in their designated throwing boxes. The
        Referee will indicate the start of a 2-minute warm up during which time
        the Side may propel all their balls, including the Jack. The athletes
        exit through the back of their throwing boxes and the other Side enters
        for their separate warm up. When one Side is warming up, the other Side
        must wait behind their own throwing box.
      </p>
      <p>
        The warm up is finished when both Sides have played all their balls or
        when 2 minutes for each side have expired, (whichever comes first.)
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.2</strong> <strong>Time per End</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.2.1</strong> Each Side will have a time limit for the playing
        of each End and is monitored by a timekeeper. The times are:
      </p>
      <p>· BC1: 5 minutes per Athlete per End</p>
      <p>· BC2: 4 minutes per Athlete per End</p>
      <p>· BC3: 6 minutes per Athlete per End</p>
      <p>· BC4: 4 minutes per Athlete per End</p>
      <p>· Teams: 6 minutes per Team per End</p>
      <p>· Pair BC3: 7 minutes per Pair per End</p>
      <p>· Pair BC4: 5 minutes per Pair per End</p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.2.2</strong> propelling the Jack is counted as part of a
        Side's time allocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.2.3</strong> A Side's time shall start when the Referee
        indicates to the timekeeper which Side should play, including the Jack.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.2.4</strong> A Side's time will stop the moment the played
        ball becomes stationary within the court boundaries or crosses the court
        boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.2.5</strong> If a Side has not released the ball when the
        time limit is reached, that ball and other remaining balls of that Side
        become invalid and shall be placed in the dead ball designated area. In
        the case of BC3 Athletes the ball has been released once it starts to
        roll down the ramp.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.2.6</strong> If a Side releases a ball after the time limit
        is reached then the Referee will stop the ball and remove it from the
        court before it disturbs play. If the ball disturbs any other balls the
        End will be disrupted (ref.: 12).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.2.7</strong> The time limit for penalty balls is one minute
        for each violation (1 ball) for all divisions of play.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.2.8</strong> During each End the remaining time for both
        Sides will be displayed on the scoreboard. At the completion of each End
        the remaining time of both Sides will be noted on the score sheet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.2.9</strong> During the playing of an End, if the time is
        incorrectly calculated, the Referee will adjust the timing to compensate
        for the error.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.2.10</strong> During matters of dispute or confusion, the
        Referee must stop the time clock. If it is necessary to stop during an
        End for translation, the time must be stopped. Whenever possible, the
        translator should not be from the same Team/country as the Athlete
        (ref.: 17.8).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.2.11</strong> The timekeeper shall announce, loud and clear,
        when the remaining time is “1 minute”, “30 seconds”, “10 seconds”; and
        “Time”, when the time is expired. During the “one minute” between Ends
        the timekeeper shall announce “15 seconds!” and “Time!” The Referee is
        to repeat the call, so the sides know the call is for their court.
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.3 Propelling the Jack</strong></p>
      <p>
        When propelling any ball (Jack, red or blue), the Athlete must have all
        their equipment, balls and belongings inside their own throwing box. For
        BC3 Athletes this includes the Ramp Operator.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.3.1</strong> The Side playing red always initiates the first
        End.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.3.2</strong> The Athlete may only propel the Jack after the
        Referee indicates it is that Side’s turn to play. BC3 Athletes must make
        the two-way swing prior to propelling the Jack.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.3.3</strong> The Jack must come to rest in the valid area for
        the Jack.
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.4 Fouled Jack</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10.4.1</strong> The Jack will be fouled if:</p>
      <p>· when played, it comes to rest in the non-valid area for the Jack;</p>
      <p>· it goes out of bounds;</p>
      <p>
        · a violation is committed by the Athlete propelling the Jack. The
        appropriate penalty in rule 15<strong>.</strong>1 to 15.11 will also be
        awarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.4.2</strong> If the Jack is fouled, then the Athlete who is
        due to propel the Jack on the next End will propel the Jack. If the Jack
        is fouled on the final End, the Athlete that threw the Jack on the first
        End will propel the Jack. Propelling the Jack will continue to advance
        in sequence until the Jack is valid.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.4.3</strong> When the Jack is fouled, the following End will
        be started in sequential order (the Jack will be propelled by the
        Athlete who is due to propel the Jack for that End.)
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.5 Propelling the first coloured ball into court</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.5.1</strong> The Athlete who successfully propels the Jack
        also propels the first coloured ball (ref.: 15.5.8). If there is a
        lengthy delay between propelling the Jack and the first coloured ball
        (e.g., because of a time clock malfunction) the Athlete may ask to
        propel the Jack again prior to propelling the first coloured ball. The
        time will be reset to the End’s start time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.5.2</strong> If the coloured ball lands out of bounds, or is
        retracted following a violation, that Side will continue to propel until
        a ball lands in the playing area of the court or all their balls have
        been propelled. In the Team and Pair Division any Athlete, from the Side
        indicated to play, may propel the second coloured ball into the playing
        area.
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.6 Propelling the first opposition ball</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.6</strong> All Athletes must be “Out of the Way” to allow
        opponents free access to the playing area. Getting “Out of the Way” must
        be done quickly. In the BC3 Division ROs and equipment (including the
        ramp and RO’s chair) must be “out of the way”. If a Side fails to make a
        conscious or deliberate effort to be"Out of the way", the Side will be
        verbally warned, and the referee will correct theopponent'stime if
        necessary. If it happens a second or consecutive time, the referee will
        award a violation according to rule 15.6. This decision should be made
        according to the referee's own understandingof the situation and whose
        decision will be final. The opposing Side will then play according to
        10.5.2. If a referee feels that an athlete is deliberately delaying a
        match by not being “out of the way”, a yellow card may be given
        according to rule 15.9.4.
      </p>

      <p><strong>10.7</strong> <strong>Movement on Court</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.7.1</strong> A Side may not prepare their next shot, orient
        the wheelchair or the ramp, or roll the ball in the opposing Sides’ time
        (before the colour is shown, it is acceptable for an Athlete to pick up
        a ball without propelling it: (e.g. it is permitted for red to pick up
        their ball before the Referee signals for blue to play and to put the
        ball in their hand or lap; it is not permissible for red to pick up a
        ball after the Referee has signalled for blue to play.) (ref.: 15.6.4).
        Movement and preparation are permitted during “Dead Time” or “Referee
        Time.” When the referee shows the colour indicator, the Side to play
        will position themselves in their throwing box, while the other Side
        moves, or remains, completely outside and behind their own throwing box.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.7.2</strong> Once the Referee has indicated to the Athlete
        which Side is to play, Athletes from that Side position themselves in
        their throwing box and are free to enter the playing area or any empty
        throwing box (ref 15.6.1). Athletes are allowed to orient the ramp from
        their own or any empty throwing box. Athletes and SAs/ROs should not go
        into opponents’ throwing boxes while preparing their next shot or to
        orient a ramp. SA/RO should NOT enter the playing area either, during
        the End, while preparing their shot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>10.7.3</strong> Athletes may go, or stay behind their throwing
        boxes to line up their shots. At least one front wheel must remain
        inside the Athlete’s own throwing box during this time. When allowed to
        communicate, athletes must be directly behind or in their own throwing
        box. Teammates may communicate with each other as they are coming into
        the throwing box, but may not meet together behind the throwing boxes.
        The path behind the boxes may be used by BC3 Athletes to enter the
        playing area. If they wish to enter the playing area for Pair BC3 they
        must do so without passing behind their own teammate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Athletes and ROs breaking this movement on court rule will be told to
        stay in the proper area and begin setup again. Elapsed time is not
        restored.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.7.4</strong> If any Athlete needs assistance to go onto the
        court, they may ask the Referee or the Linesperson to assist them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.7.5</strong> In a Team or Pair match if an Athlete propels a
        ball and their teammate is still returning to their throwing box, the
        Referee will give a 1 ball penalty plus the retraction of this propelled
        ball (ref.: 15.7.7). The returning Athlete (non-propelling) must have at
        least one wheel inside his/her own throwing box when the teammate
        releases the ball.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.7.6</strong> Routine actions before or after the release of a
        ball are allowed without a specific request having to be made to the
        Sport Assistant or Ramp Operator.
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.8 Propelling balls</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.8.1</strong> When the ball is released, the Athlete must have
        at least one buttock in contact with the seat of the wheelchair.
        Athletes who can only play while on their abdomen, must have their
        abdomen in contact with the throwing chair (ref.: 15.7.3). Such Athletes
        must have documented classification approval for this method.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.8.2</strong> If a ball is played and bounces off the Athlete
        who threw it, or off an opposing Athlete or his/her equipment, and
        crosses the throwing line, it is in play.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.8.3</strong> A ball, after being thrown, kicked, or exiting
        the bottom of a ramp, may roll out of the side of the Athlete’s throwing
        box (either in the air or on the floor), and through an opposing Side’s
        throwing box, before crossing the throwing line and going into the
        playing area.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.8.4</strong> If a ball in play rolls on its own, without
        being touched by anything, it will remain on the playing area in the new
        position.
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.9 Playing the remaining balls</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.9.1</strong> The Side to play next will be the Side which
        does not have the closest ball to the Jack, unless they have used all
        their balls, in which case the other Side will play. This procedure will
        continue until both Sides have played all balls. Opponents must move
        “out of the way” when it is not their turn. In the BC3 Division ROs and
        equipment (including the ramp and RO’s chair) must be “out of the way”.
        If a Side fails to make a conscious or deliberate effort to move "out of
        the way", the Side will be verbally warned, and the referee will correct
        the opponents time if necessary. If it happens a second or consecutive
        time, the referee will award a violation according to rule 15.6. This
        decision should be made according to the referee's own understandingof
        the situation and whose decision will be final. If a referee feels that
        an athlete is deliberately delaying a match by not being “out of the
        way”, a yellow card may be given according to rule 15.9.4.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.9.2</strong> If an Athlete decides not to play any remaining
        balls, they may indicate to the Referee that they do not wish to play
        any more balls during that End. In this case time will be stopped, and
        the remaining balls will be declared Dead Ball(s). Balls Not Played will
        be recorded as (BNP) on the score sheet.
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.10 Balls out of Bounds</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.10.1</strong> Any ball is out of bounds, if it touches or
        crosses the exterior boundary lines. If the ball is touching the line
        and supporting another ball, the ball on the line will be removed. If
        the supported ball falls and touches the line, that ball will also be
        out of bounds and will be removed. Each ball will be dealt with
        according to 10.10.3 for a coloured ball or 10.11.1 for the jack ball. A
        ball that touches or crosses the exterior boundary line and then
        re-enters the playing area is out of bounds and becomes a dead ball.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.10.2</strong> A ball, which is played and fails to enter the
        playing area, except in the case of rule 10.14, will be considered out
        of bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.10.3</strong> Any coloured ball that is propelled or knocked
        out of bounds becomes a Dead Ball and is placed in the designated area.
        The Referee is the sole arbiter as to whether a ball is out of bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dead balls are to be placed in the designated area - a dead ball
        container, or just outside the boundary line at least 1m from the balls
        in the playing area. This allows Athletes the room to manoeuvre
        completely around the balls and to clearly see the balls in play.
      </p>

      <p><strong>10.11 Jack knocked out of Bounds</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.11.1</strong> If the Jack is knocked out of the playing area,
        or into the non-valid area for the Jack during the match, it is
        repositioned on the cross.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.11.2</strong> If this is not possible because a ball is
        already covering the cross, the Jack will be placed as close as possible
        in front of the cross with the ball centred between the side-lines (‘in
        front of the cross’ refers to the area between the cross and the
        throwing line).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.11.3</strong> When the Jack has been placed on the cross the
        Side to play next will be determined according to rule 10.9.1
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.11.4</strong> If there are no coloured balls on the playing
        area after the Jack has been replaced, the Side, which knocked the Jack
        out, will play.
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.12 Balls played together</strong></p>
      <p>
        If a Side plays more than one ball when it is that Side's turn to play,
        the simultaneously played balls will be retracted and become Dead Balls
        (ref.: 15.5.11).
      </p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>10.13 Equidistant balls</strong></p>
      <p>
        When determining which Side is to play next, if two or more balls of
        different colours are equidistant from the Jack, and the score of these
        equidistant balls is equal (1:1; 2:2); it is the Side that threw last
        that must play again. The Side to play will then alternate until either
        the equidistant relationship is disturbed, or one Side has played all of
        its balls. If balls are equidistant but the score of the equidistant
        balls is not equal (2:1), the Side with the fewer equidistant balls will
        play. Play will then continue as normal. When the current balls are
        scoring as 2-1, the score and the situation is NOT equidistant. If a
        newly played ball disturbs the equidistant relationship, but remains to
        make a different but still equidistant relationship, that same colour
        must play again.
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.14 Dropped ball</strong></p>
      <p>
        If an Athlete drops a ball, it may be replayed. Balls that land in the
        playing area are "balls in play" Balls that stay on or behind the
        throwing line, even in the opponent’s throwing box, are "dropped" and
        may be replayed. There is no limit to the number of times a ball may be
        replayed and the Referee is the sole arbiter. In this case, time will
        not be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
        · As long as the ball is not fully grasped by the athlete (e.g. while
        picking up a ball from anywhere the ball is stored or while the
        assistant is giving the ball to the athlete, or while placing the ball
        on the ramp), any ball that drops is clearly dropped by accident and
        unrelated to throwing. The ball is returned to the athlete, regardless
        of where it lands.
      </p>
      <p>
        · Once the athlete holds the ball and has started shot preparation
        and/or execution, if that ball is then dropped, it is only returned to
        the athlete if it has not entered the playing area.
      </p>

      <p><strong>10.15 Completion of an End</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.15.1</strong> After all balls have been played and there are
        no penalty balls, the Referee will verbally announce the score (ref.:
        10.16) and then, “End finished.” (If the Referee needs to measure to
        determine the score, he/she will invite the Athletes/captains to the
        playing area. Ramp Operators may turn at this time to watch the measure.
        After the measure, the Athletes return to their throwing boxes; the
        Referee announces the score and “End finished”) At the completion of the
        match the Referee will announce, “Match Finished” and will announce and
        indicate the final score.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>10.15.2</strong> If there are penalty balls to be played, after
        acknowledging the End score with the athletes/captains and allowing the
        ROs to turn briefly to see the balls, the playing area will be cleared
        by the Referee (the lines person may assist). The Side awarded a penalty
        ball will select any one (1) of their coloured balls, which will be
        propelled at the target box. The Referee will verbally announce the
        tallied score (ref.: 11) and then, “End finished.” This is the signal to
        the ROs that they may turn to face the playing area at this time. The
        total score from the End is recorded on the score sheet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>10.15.3</strong> In the final End of a match, if all the balls
        have not been played and the winner is obvious, no penalty will be
        incurred if the SA, RO. or Coach/CA on court cheers. This also applies
        for penalty balls.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.15.4</strong> Sport Assistants, Ramp Operators and
        Coaches/Coaching Assistants may enter the playing area only when
        directed by the Referee (ref.:15.9.7). At the end of the End, when the
        Referee announces, “One minute!” while holding the Jack or coloured ball
        aloft; this is a signal to the SA, RO and Coach/CA that they may enter
        the playing area.
      </p>
      <p><strong>10.16 Scoring</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.16.1</strong> Scoring will take place by the Referee after
        both Sides have played all balls The Side with the ball closest to the
        Jack will score one point for each ball closer to the Jack than the
        opponent’s closest ball to the Jack.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.16.2.2</strong> If two or more balls of different colours are
        equidistant from the Jack and no other balls are closer, then each Side
        will receive one point per ball.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.16.3</strong> Penalty ball points, if any, are added to the
        score and recorded when made. Each penalty ball that stops within the
        target box will score one (1) point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.16.4</strong> At the completion of each End the Referee must
        be sure that the score is correct on the score sheet and the scoreboard.
        Athletes / captains are responsible for ensuring that the scores are
        recorded accurately.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.16.5</strong> At the completion of the Ends, the points
        scored on each End are added together and the Side with the higher total
        score is the winner.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.16.6</strong> The Referee may call captains (or Athletes, in
        Individual Division) forward if measuring has to take place, or the
        decision is close at the end of an End.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.16.7</strong> If the scores are equal after the regulation
        Ends have been played, including any penalty balls, a tie break End is
        played. The points scored in a tie break End will not count towards a
        Side’s tally in that match; it will only determine the winner.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.16.8</strong> If a Side forfeits a match, then the opposing
        Side is awarded the match by the higher score of 6-0; or the greatest
        points difference in any match in that pool or knock out series. The
        Side which has forfeited the match will score zero. If both Sides
        forfeit, they both forfeit the match by the higher score of 6-0, or the
        greatest points difference of that pool or knock out series. The score
        will be recorded for each Side as “forfeit by 0-(?)”.
      </p>
      <p>
        If both Sides forfeit the match, the Technical Delegate and Head Referee
        will decide the appropriate action.
      </p>

      <p id="preparation_for_subsequent_ends">
        <strong>11. Preparation for subsequent Ends for All Divisions</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Referee will allow a maximum of one minute between Ends. The
        one-minute begins when the Referee picks up the Jack from off the floor
        and announces “One Minute.” Sport Assistants, Ramp Operators, Coaches
        and/or Coaching Assistants are responsible for retrieving the balls for
        the beginning of the next End. Officials may assist, if requested. Any
        balls not in the Athletes throwing boxes, (or secured on their
        wheelchair) at the beginning of the End will be “Dead Balls”.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 45 seconds the Referee will call “15 seconds!”, acquire the
        correct Jack and proceed to the throwing line. At one minute, the
        Referee will call “Time!”. All actions of the opposing Side must stop
        when the Referee gives the Jack to the Athlete who is to play. The
        Referee asks for “Jack!”. If the opposing Side is not ready, they must
        wait until the Referee indicates their turn to play, at which time they
        may complete their preparation. (ref 15.6.4)
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Referee calls, “Time!”, Athletes slated to play must be in
        their throwing boxes; SAs, ROs and Coaches/CAs are to be in their
        designated areas.” Penalty: a yellow card for delaying a match (ref.:
        15.9.4). Opposing athletes must be behind their own throwing box, “ready
        to play” for when the paddle colour changes. All items required for play
        during the end must be inside their own throwing box or firmly placed on
        the wheelchair. (e.g. Balls and ramp extensions)
      </p>
      <p id="disrupted_end"><strong>12 Disrupted End</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>12.1</strong> An End is disrupted when balls, or a ball, have
        been moved by contact from an Athlete or the Referee, or by a ball
        played during a violation that the Referee fails to stop. (ref :15.8.2)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12.2</strong> If an End is disrupted due to a Referee's action
        (e.g.,the Referee kicks a ball, or shows the incorrect colour), the
        Referee, in consultation with the Linesperson, will return the disturbed
        balls to their previous position (the Referee will always respect the
        undisturbed score, even if the balls are not in their exact preceding
        position). If the Referee does not know what the score was, or cannot
        reposition the disturbed balls, then the End must be restarted. The
        Referee will be the final judge. The End will restart at the status
        where the disruption was caused - retracted balls from both sides will
        remain in the dead ball area; if the Jack has been fouled, the Jack will
        be replayed by the Athlete who made the last legitimate play.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the wrong colour is shown by the Referee and that colour ball is
        played, the ball is returned and time reinstated. If other balls are
        disturbed, and if the Referee cannot reposition the balls fairly, this
        will become a disrupted End and restarted.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>12.3</strong> If an End is disrupted due to a Side's error or
        action, the Referee will take action as described in rule 12.2 but will
        consult with both Sides and the Linesperson in order to avoid making any
        unfair decisions. The Referee may consult the overhead camera, if
        available (12.5) The camera check is at the discretion of the Head
        Referee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12.4</strong> If a disrupted End needs to be restarted and
        penalty balls have been awarded, the penalty ball(s) will be played at
        the completion of the restarted End. If the Athlete or Side that caused
        the disrupted End has previously been awarded penalty ball(s) in that
        End, they will now not be allowed to play those penalty balls. If the
        disruption was caused by a ball played under violation, that ball and
        all retracted balls from the offending side will remain in the dead ball
        area for the restarted End.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12.5</strong> At major competitions (World Championships and the
        Paralympics Games) overhead cameras will be used on each court to enable
        the Referee to replace balls quickly and accurately in their exact
        previous positions. [Note from 2023 overhead cameras will also be
        required on each court at all Regional Championships.]

      <p id="tie_break"><strong>13 Tie Break</strong></p>
      <p><strong>13.1</strong> A tie break constitutes an extra End.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>13.2</strong> Athletes will remain in their original throwing
        boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>13.3</strong> If the score is tied after regulation number of
        Ends in a match (and after any penalty balls have been played) the
        Referee will perform a coin toss before announcing the “One Minute”. The
        Side that did not make the coin toss call in the Call Room, will make
        the call for the tie break. The winner of this coin toss decides which
        Side will play the first coloured ball. The Referee will then retrieve
        the Jack (or penalty ball) from the floor of the playing area and make
        the “One Minute!” call.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>13.4</strong> At “Time!”, after the one minute between ends, the
        Referee will place the Jack of the side that plays first, on the cross.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>13.5</strong> The tie break is then played as a normal End. In
        the BC3 Individual Division, prior to the release of their first
        coloured ball (both red and blue), each Athlete MUST make the two-way
        swing. In Pair BC3, ALL Athletes (both red and blue, on their own turn)
        MUST make the simultaneous two-way swing after the Referee signals their
        Side to play, and prior to releasing their first ball (ref.: 4.1.6,
        15.5.9 – retraction of the played ball).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>13.6</strong> If a situation detailed in rule 10.16.7 occurs and
        each Side receives equal points on the tie break the scores are recorded
        and a second tie break is played. This time the opposing Side will begin
        the tie break with their Jack on the cross. This procedure continues,
        with the first play alternating between Sides, until there is a winner.
      </p>
      <p id="post_match_ball_check">
        <strong>14 Post-Match Ball Check</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of every match the referee will conduct the ball inspection
        procedure for each of the seven (7) balls a side has used during the
        match. The referee will complete the ball inspection before the balls
        are returned to the athlete or collected by their assistant. The
        procedure for the post-match ball inspection is defined in the Referee’s
        Procedure Manual.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a ball fails the ball inspection procedure completed by the match
        referee, then the head referee or assistant head referee will check and
        verify the result of the ball inspection procedure. If the ball(s) is
        confirmed to have failed the ball inspection then the ball will be
        confiscated, the athlete awarded a yellow card, and the result of the
        match will be recorded as a forfeit.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one Athlete has more than one ball rejected during the same check,
        the offence will incur only one yellow card.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an Athlete's ball(s) fails the criteria during the ball check for a
        subsequent match, that Athlete receives a second yellow card and will
        forfeit the match under rules 15.10.2 and 15.10.3.
      </p>
      <p>
        Athletes, SAs/ROs and Coaches/Coaching Assistants may observe the ball
        check. If a ball fails, the test is not reattempted, unless the referee
        did not follow the correct test procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Team and Pair Division Athletes must identify each Athlete’s
        equipment and balls so that if an item fails a check, it can be
        correctly associated with the correct Athlete. If ownership is not
        admitted, the captain will be assumed to be the owner.
      </p>

      <p><strong>VIOLATIONS and DISPUTES</strong></p>
      <p id="violations"><strong>15. Violations</strong></p>
      <p>In the case of a violation there can be one or more consequences:</p>
      <p>· Retraction</p>
      <p>· One ball penalty</p>
      <p>· One ball penalty plus the retraction</p>
      <p>· One ball penalty plus a yellow card</p>
      <p>· Yellow Card</p>
      <p>· Red Card (Disqualification)</p>
      <p>All violations are recorded on the score sheet</p>
      <p>
        An Athlete and their SA/RO are considered as a single unit – any yellow
        or red cards the SA/RO receives are awarded to their Athlete also.
        Conversely, yellow and red cards awarded to an Athlete apply also to
        their SA/RO.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Coach or Coaching Assistant is considered a single unit; if a Coach or
        Coaching Assistant receives a yellow or red card, it does not transfer
        to the Side.
      </p>
      <p><strong>15.1 Retraction</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.1.1</strong> A retraction is the removal of a ball from the
        court. The retracted ball will be placed in the designated area; on the
        floor or in a dead ball container.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.1.2</strong> A retraction can only be given for a violation
        which occurs during the release of a ball.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.1.3</strong> If a violation is committed which leads to a
        retraction the Referee will always try to stop the ball before it
        dislodges other balls.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.1.4</strong> If the Referee fails to stop the ball before it
        dislodges other balls, the End will be deemed to be a disrupted End
        (ref.: 12.1-12.4).
      </p>
      <p><strong>15.2 One Ball Penalty</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.2.1</strong> A one ball penalty is the award of one extra
        ball to the opposing Side. This ball will be played after all the balls
        have been played in an End. The Referee tabulates and the Scorekeeper
        records the score; all balls will be removed from the playing area and
        the Side awarded the penalty ball will select any one (1) of their
        coloured balls, which will be propelled towards the target box. The
        Referee will show the colour indicator and call “One minute!”. The
        Athlete has 1 minute to play the penalty ball. If this ball stops inside
        the 35cm target box without touching the outside line, the Side playing
        the penalty ball is awarded one additional point. In the case of a
        penalty ball, the clock will be reset to 1 minute after noting the
        current remaining time on the score sheet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.2.2</strong> If more than one violation occurs during an End
        by one Side more than one penalty ball can be awarded. Each penalty ball
        is played separately. The played ball is removed and tabulated (if it is
        scoring) and the Side selects from all their coloured balls to play any
        subsequent penalty balls.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.2.3</strong> Violations committed by both Sides do not cancel
        each other out. Each Side will attempt to earn their penalty point(s).
        The first penalty ball will be played by the Side that received the
        first penalty ball, after which plays will alternate between the sides
        for any remaining penalty balls.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.2.4</strong> If a violation that leads to the award of a
        penalty ball is committed while a penalty ball is being played, the
        Referee will award a penalty ball to the opposing Side.
      </p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>15.3 Yellow Card</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.3.1</strong> When committing a violation listed in rule 15.9
        a yellow card will be shown and the Referee will note the violation on
        the score sheet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.3.2</strong> If an Athlete earns two (2) yellow cards during
        a competition the Athlete is barred from the current match. The match is
        lost by forfeit (ref.: 10.16.8).
      </p>
      <p>
        For the second yellow card and each subsequent yellow card that an
        individual receives, he/she will be barred from the remainder of the
        current match, but is eligible to play any remaining matches in the
        competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.3.3</strong> When an athlete receives a yellow card for
        failing the post-match ball check, that match is lost by forfeit.
      </p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>15.4 Red Card (Disqualification)</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.4.1</strong> When an Athlete, Coach, Coaching Assistant, Ramp
        Operator or Sport Assistant is disqualified, a red card will be shown,
        and recorded on the score sheet. A red card always means an immediate
        disqualification from the competition (ref.: 15.11.4).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.4.2</strong> If an Athlete and/or their SA/RO is
        disqualified, the Side will forfeit the match (ref.: 10.16.8).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.4.3</strong> A disqualified individual may be reinstated for
        future competitions at the same tournament at the discretion of the Head
        Referee and Technical Delegate. If the red card has been awarded for
        ball tampering, then the individual is not allowed to be reinstated at
        the same tournament. (ref.; 5.3)

        <strong>15.9.2</strong> An Athlete, Pair or Team bringing to the Call

        competition. The Athlete who brings the extra balls may indicate which
        balls are to be confiscated.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Team and Pair Division, the yellow card is given to the Athlete who

        criteria during a ball check (ref.: 8 and 14.). The entire process of
        checking the balls is one event. Should an athlete bring too many balls
        AND lose a ball during one of the ball tests, he/she would receive ONE
        yellow card, NOT two. A notice will be posted at the entrance to the
        Call Room listing failed balls and failed equipment and all yellow
        cards.

        <strong>16 Clarification and Dispute Procedure</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>16.1</strong> During a match a Side may feel that the Referee
        has overlooked an event or made an incorrect decision, which affects the
        result of the match. At that time, the Athlete/captain of that Side may
        draw the Referee's attention to this situation and seek clarification.
        The time must be stopped (ref.: 10.2.10).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>16.2</strong> During the match an Athlete/captain may request a
        ruling from the HR, whose decision is final and the match continues. No
        further protests can be made. If overhead cameras are in use, the HR may
        use such evidence in reaching a decision.
      </p>

      <p><strong>COMMUNICATION</strong></p>
      <p id="communication"><strong>17 Communication</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>17.1</strong> There will be no communication between Athlete,
        Sport Assistant, Ramp Operator or Coach/Coaching Assistant during an
        End.
      </p>
      <p>The exceptions are:</p>
      <p>
        · when an Athlete requests his/her SA/RO to carry out a specific action
        such as altering the position of the wheelchair, moving an assistive
        device, rolling the ball or passing the ball to the Athlete. Some
        routine actions are allowed without a specific request to the SA/RO,
      </p>
      <p>
        · Coaches/CAs, SAs/ROs, may congratulate or offer encouragement to
        Athletes on their Side after a shot and between Ends
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>17.2</strong> In Team and Pair Division, during the playing of
        an End Athletes may only communicate with their teammates that are on
        court after the Referee has indicated that it is their turn to play.
        During an End, when neither Side has been indicated to play (eg: during
        a measure by a Referee; a time clock malfunction) Athletes from both
        sides may converse quietly but must cease as soon as the opposing Side
        has been indicated to play.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>17.3</strong> An Athlete may not instruct his/her teammate’s
        Sport Assistant(Team) or Ramp Operator(Pair). Each Athlete may only
        communicate directly with his or her own Sport Assistant/Ramp Operator.
        A BC3 Athlete may use a common sheet or chart to give commands to their
        teammate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>17.4</strong> Between Ends, Athletes may communicate between
        themselves, their SA/RO and their Coach/CA. This communication must
        cease once the Referee is ready to begin the End. The Referee will not
        delay the match to allow for further discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>17.5</strong> An Athlete may ask another Athlete or RO to move
        if he/she is positioned in a way which interferes with the playing of a
        shot, but cannot ask them to go out of their throwing box. During a
        match, the RO should ensure their equipment is out of the way so that
        the opponent can easily make their shot, without causing damage to any
        belongings that are in the way. To prevent damage, ROs should not move
        the opponents’ equipment. During a match, the RO should move their own
        ramp/belongings out of the way of the opponent to allow the shot to be
        played without interference.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>17.6</strong> Any Athlete may speak to the Referee in his or her
        own time. SAs/ROs may only relay messages for the Athlete and Referee
        with the Referee’s permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>17.7</strong> After the Referee indicates which Side will play,
        any Athlete from that Side may ask for the score or for a measure.
        Requests about ball positioning (e.g., which opponent’s ball is closer?)
        will not be answered by the Referee. The Athletes may come onto the
        playing area to assess for themselves how the balls are positioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>17.8</strong> If translation is required on the court during a
        match, the HR will have full authority to select an appropriate
        translator. The HR will first attempt to use either a competition sport
        volunteer or another Referee who is not currently involved in another
        match or select the translator from their designated area.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>17.9</strong> Translators will not be seated on the FOP.
        Translators need to be in their designated area. No match will be
        delayed if a translator is not present when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>17.10</strong> Any communication device, including a smart phone
        taken onto the FOP by an athlete must be approved during Equipment Check
        and receive a valid sticker, by the HR or designate. Unapproved
        communication devices are NOT allowed on the FOP. Any misuse will be
        inappropriate communication and warrant a one ball penalty to be played
        at the 1st opportunity (Ref: 4; 15.6.3).
      </p>
      <p>
        Coaches/Coaching Assistants are permitted to use tablets and smartphones
        to take notes (Such devices must be in a mode - e.g., ‘airplane mode’ -
        that is unable to communicate with the Athletes on court. Referees have
        the authority at any time during the match to check the Coach’s/CA’s
        device to ensure it is not in communication mode). Athletes and SAs/ROs
        on court must not receive any communication (electronic, vocal, signals)
        from outside the court during an End. Electronic devices may NOT be
        taken onto the court, unless approved during equipment check. Any
        infringement of this rule is inappropriate communication and warrants a
        one ball penalty.

      <p><strong>TIME OUTS</strong></p>
      <p id="medical_time_out"><strong>18. Medical Time Out</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>18.1</strong> If an Athlete or SA/RO becomes ill during a match
        (it must be a serious situation) any Athlete may ask for a medical time
        out if necessary. A match may be interrupted for a medical time out for
        ten (10) minutes during which the Referee must stop the timing of the
        match. In BC3 division, during the ten-minute medical time out, Ramp
        Operators may not look into the playing area.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>18.2</strong> An Athlete or SA or RO may only receive one (1)
        medical time out per match.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>18.3</strong> Any Athlete or SA or RO who receives a medical
        time out must be seen on court as soon as possible by the medical
        personnel assigned to the venue. The medical personnel may be assisted
        with communication from the Athlete or SA/RO, if necessary. The medical
        timeout begins immediately when signalled, but the time will not start
        to count down until the medic arrives at the court.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>18.4</strong> In any Division, if an Athlete is unable to
        continue, all remaining balls become dead balls.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>18.5</strong> When the medical time out is called for a Sport
        Assistant/Ramp Operator, and the SA/RO is unable to continue after the
        time out, if the Athlete has any balls remaining, but cannot play them
        unassisted, they will become dead ball(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>18.6</strong> If an Athlete continues to ask for medical time
        outs in subsequent matches, the TD in consultation with medical
        personnel and a representative of that Athlete’s country will determine
        if that Athlete should be removed from the remainder of the competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Individual Division if an Athlete is removed from the remainder
        of the competition, all subsequent matches that they would have played
        will have the higher score of 6-0; or the greatest points difference in
        any match in that pool or knock out series.
      </p>
      <p id="technical_time_out"><strong>19. Technical Time Out</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>19.1</strong> Once per match, if any equipment breaks, time must
        be stopped and the Athlete will be given a one ten (10) minute technical
        time out to repair their equipment. In a Pairs match, an Athlete may
        share a ramp with his/her teammate if necessary. A replacement ramp or
        replacement wheelchair may be substituted between Ends (the Head Referee
        must be notified of this). Repair items, including a replacement ramp or
        replacement wheelchair, may come from outside the FOP. An Official
        (Liner, Timer, Referee…) must accompany the personnel doing the repair.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>19.2</strong> If the equipment cannot be repaired (or replaced
        between the ends), the athlete must carry on playing with the broken
        equipment.If the athlete is unable to continue, any remaining balls for
        that athlete will become dead balls.
